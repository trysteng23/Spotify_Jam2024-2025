1. Vote skip functionality
2. Save the whole queue list from a session
3. If nothing is queued, resort to a playlist that was chosen
4. Allow users to prioritize a song that they queued
5. Show who is playing the current song
6. Visual of the next songs to be played (not next songs an individual has queued)
7. If you click on user, you can see all their queued songs.
8. CHALLENGE: Balancing updates when multiple people are queueing and songs are being played.
9. Analytics / ability for people to see fun stats like "most played user", "least contributions", etc.
10. refine model to use websockets so that pages automatically refresh for users. Using WSS (Web socket secure) should definitely be used so that things like host user access token
11. Perhaps scrapping the manually made authentication file for a more robust and refined library like Spotipy could be very useful for further development.
